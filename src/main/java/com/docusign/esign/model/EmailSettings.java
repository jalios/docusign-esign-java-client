/**
 * A complex element that allows the sender to override some envelope email setting information.
 * This can be used to override the Reply To email address and name associated with the envelope and
 * to override the BCC email addresses to which an envelope is sent. When the emailSettings
 * information is used for an envelope, it only applies to that envelope. **IMPORTANT**: The
 * emailSettings information is not returned in the GET for envelope status. Use GET /email_settings
 * to return information about the emailSettings. EmailSettings consists of: *
 * replyEmailAddressOverride - The Reply To email used for the envelope. DocuSign will verify that a
 * correct email format is used, but does not verify that the email is active. Maximum Length: 100
 * characters. * replyEmailNameOverride - The name associated with the Reply To email address.
 * Maximum Length: 100 characters. * bccEmailAddresses - An array of up to five email addresses to
 * which the envelope is sent to as a BCC email. Only users with canManageAccount setting set to
 * true can use this option. DocuSign verifies that the email format is correct, but does not verify
 * that the email is active. Using this overrides the BCC for Email Archive information setting for
 * this envelope. Maximum Length: 100 characters. *Example*: if your account has BCC for Email
 * Archive set up for the email address &#39;archive@mycompany.com&#39; and you send an envelope
 * using the BCC Email Override to send a BCC email to &#39;salesarchive@mycompany.com&#39;, then a
 * copy of the envelope is only sent to the &#39;salesarchive@mycompany.com&#39; email address..
